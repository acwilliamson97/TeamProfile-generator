# TeamProfile-generator

This Node CLI application creates a webpage based on user inputs that displays their name, email, role, and other relevant information depending on their role. For example, interns are asked to provide the name of the school they attend, whereas engineers are asked to provide their GitHub username. The Inquirer npm package is used to prompt the user with each question.
